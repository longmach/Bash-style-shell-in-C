This project intends to create a bash-style shell in C that simulates normal bash shell.
The program includes built-in commands such as exit, cd, and status.
The program can run child processes, handle signals from the OS, allow the processes to be ran in the
background, redirect file descriptor, and handle all other input commands like a bash shell.
